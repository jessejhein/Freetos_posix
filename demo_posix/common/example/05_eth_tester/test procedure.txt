*Perform IO READ/WRITE TEST using Demo Program
**Press 't', expecting response
   Vendor ID OK.
   8-bit mode.
   ERR: DM9000A is not able to link to the Internet.
**Press 'n' and 'p' several times to see if there are any abnormal behaviour (e.g. all read 0x00, all read 0x80, or response follows input)

*Solder RJ45 connector
*Clean board with alcohol and blow-dry with compressed oxygen
*Check dirts under magnifier

*Perform IO READ/WRITE TEST using Demo Program
**Press 't', expecting response
   Vendor ID OK.
   8-bit mode.
   Link OK.
   10Base-T Half duplex obtained.
**Press 'n' and 'p' several times to see if there are any abnormal behaviour (e.g. all read 0x00, all read 0x80, or response follows input)
**Press 'r' to receive packets

*Perform WEBSERVER TEST
*Checklist
**Obtain IP?
**Irregular display?
**Capability to response to web-brower?
**Long Run?


===TROUBLESHOOTING===
*Japanese characters on lcd display + lost ip address
*Symptoms
**open ok -> get ip by DHCP -> read: no link 0x00 -> open: no link 0x00 -> get ip by DHCP -> read: no link 0x00 -> open: no land card 0x00
*Possible Cause
**Data Pin 7 (D7, Pin 10) is shorted/partially shorted with CT (Pin 9, 2.5V)
