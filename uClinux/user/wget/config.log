This file contains any messages produced by compilers while
running configure, to aid debugging if configure makes a mistake.

It was created by configure, which was
generated by GNU Autoconf 2.57.  Invocation command line was

  $ ./configure --target=m68k-elf --disable-nls --disable-debug --no-create --no-recursion
